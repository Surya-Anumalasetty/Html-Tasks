    <p><b>Visual Studio Code (VS Code)</b> is a free, streamlined code editor that helps developers write and work on code: </p>
    <h2>Features</h2>
Supports a variety of programming languages, including JavaScript, TypeScript, and Node.js. It also includes features like debugging, syntax highlighting, code completion, and version control. 
<h2>Ease of use</h2>
VS Code is easy to install and use, and it doesn't take up too much space. It's a good choice for beginners, and it's also useful for advanced programmers. 
<h2>Customization</h2>
You can change the theme, keyboard shortcuts, and preferences. You can also add extensions to do more, like work with different programming languages or tools. 
<h2>Platform support</h2>
VS Code works on Windows, Linux, and macOS. 
<h2>Community</h2>
VS Code is based on the MIT licensed program "Visual Studio Code — Open Source" (also known as "Code — OSS").

<ul>
    <li>Run tasks</li>
    <li>Use snippets</li>
    <li>Refactor code</li>
    <li>Use embedded version control with Git</li>
